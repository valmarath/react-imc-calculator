</h1>

IMC Calculator is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice React and Typescript, mainly. It's an application that calculates your index of corporal mass (IMC) based on your height and weight. Alongside the result, you will also know if your IMC is at a good or bad level.
